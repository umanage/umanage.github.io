Well, first off, UManage can't be used as a direct replacement for Trello. Yes, both apps are free to use and you can be up and running using them in a few minutes.
However, UManage runs inside your SharePoint environment -- either your Office 365 site, or your on-premise SharePoint 2013 installation.
So if you have access to **SharePoint 2013**, you are good to go with UManage.
 
## Integration with SharePoint

Because UManage is a SharePoint add-in, you get the following benefits:

- No need for another account (and password!) to remember. You work in SharePoint, then you can work in UManage without having to log in;
- Your documents can be linked with any card in UManage. No need to copy the document's URL manually and paste it in the card, you link a document 
(actually, you can link any content in SharePoint, a page, a blog post, a list item, etc.) using SharePoint's native browser.
- Since you can install UManage in any site you wish, the navigation is totally integrated. You navigate to your team site and you have access to its UManage.
You then navigate to one of your project site, and have direct access to its UManage.

## Unlimited Hierarchy of Cards

In Trello, you have a board where you organize your cards - the interface is very simple to use. The interface offers a 3 level hierarchy of "actions":

- The columns represent the first level
- The cards in a column are the second level
- A card may have one or more checklist(s) that contain tasks that represent the 3rd level

UManage offers an unlimited hierarchy of cards. A column is then simply a card which contain other cards. If you drill-down on a column, you now have access to
its child cards that are shown as columns containing cards, and so on.

## Multi-dimentional View

When you board becomes more complex, UManage allows you to see your cards using a different view. You can have up to 4 such views where you can reorganize
your cards differently.

As a real life example, let's say that you are managing a medium to complex agile project. You can use the various views as follows:

- **Strategy** contains your project objectives, each one being a column. To deliver each objective, you list in their respective column all the User Stories
that are relevant.
- **Initiative** could be used to manage the project scope. For instance, each column may be an Epic, with its User Stories listed as cards in the column.
- **Execution** -- The organization of User Stories under their Epics may not reflect the priorization and how they are related to Sprints. In this view, 
you can have a column labeled "backlog" that provides a prioritized list of User Stories. Then you may have another column for your current Sprint backlog, 
as well as columns for your Kanabn such as *Doing*, *Testing*, *Done*, etc.

As you can see, the same User Stories can be shown in more than one view, each view serving a different purpose. For a large project, there is just no way to 
accomplish this simply using Trello.

## Meeting Management

Your day is spent in numerous meetings. You exit a meeting with a bunch of action items assigned to you. It is close to impossible to track them all. Why not use UManage
during your meetings to track all its action items. Every meeting is a card and all its action items are child cards. You simply drag a card from a meeting to any view -
for example to the **Execution** view so you can prioritize and schedule it.

The Meeting management also allow you to prepare an agenda, take meeting minutes and print the results for distribution to participants.

## Mobile Apps and Outlook Connector

Trello offers very sophisticated mobile apps. UManage has a simpler view for mobile apps - we simply show cards assigned to you. We consider that when you are mobile, 
your focus is on the things that you need to complete and that you are not focused on the global management of the project.

But one are where UManage really shines is with the Outlook Connector. You spend a lot of time in Outlook during the day. You receive and Email and you need to have
someone in your team take action. Simply drag the Email to the UManage site where it should be handled. From UManage, you will see this Email in the Inbox and you simply drag it to 
the view where it makes sense to handle the action - usually the Execution view.

## One Last Thing

We aimed UManage at being the best Team/Project task management available on SharePoint. Hopefully you will enjoy using it as much as we do!
